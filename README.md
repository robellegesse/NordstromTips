# NordstromTips

Created a console based program which calculates tips based on the different tip 
percentage of every position, the hours worked, and amount working in each position 
applicable to one of the Nordstrom restaurants, Bazille.

This project is useful because there was no previou system in place for this
so different managers would have to spend hours calculating the tips for everyone
and with this program this process is incredibly faster

Currently I am the only one mainting and contributing to this project
